## Project Description:

Video Traffic Analytics: Real-time Detection, Tracking, and Counting of Moving Objects Crossing a Control Line

### Project Overview
This project implements a real-time object counting system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model. The system detects, tracks, and counts moving objects that cross a designated control line. It supports various use cases such as:

Counting people on an escalator
Counting cars on a road
Counting vaccine vials on a conveyor belt (trained on a custom dataset)

### Features
Real-time object detection and counting: Utilizes the YOLO model to count objects crossing a control line in live video feeds.
Pre-trained YOLO model: Supports generic objects like people and vehicles without additional training.
Custom dataset support: Allows custom object counting, demonstrated with vaccine vials on a conveyor belt.
Efficient tracking: Ensures accurate counting even in fast-moving environments.
